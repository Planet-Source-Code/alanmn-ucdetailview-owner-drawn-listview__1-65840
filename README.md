### Description

11/04/07: Fixes by Ed Wilk

03/04/07: ListIndex bugfix. (Thank you Ed Wilk)

29/03/07: Bugfixes.

4th July 06: Added gridlines, sorting &amp; dynamic header resize. In the process of changing to API draw functions. Thanks to TerriTop!

My previous entry used linked listboxes and was too slow when the listcount &gt; 10000 so I started a new, completely different owner drawn project. It's nearly finished but I wanted to find any bugs before I use them in my projects. Please help me complete it!!! (14KB Zip)
